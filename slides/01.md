==== TEST-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT RULES ====

TDD is a discipline. Therefore, these rules are arbitrary and are to be
followed to the letter.

1. You are not allowed to write a line of production code, unless test fails.

2. You are not allowed to write more of a test, that is sufficient to fail.

3. You are not allowed to write more production code, that is sufficient to
  make the test pass.
